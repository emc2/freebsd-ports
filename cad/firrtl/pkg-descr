Firrtl is an intermediate representation (IR) for digital circuits designed as
a platform for writing circuit-level transformations. This repository consists
of a collection of transformations (written in Scala) which simplify, verify,
transform, or emit their input circuit.

A Firrtl compiler is constructed by chaining together these transformations,
then writing the final circuit to a file.
